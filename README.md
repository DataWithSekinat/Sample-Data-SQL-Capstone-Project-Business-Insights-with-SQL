## Description
This project focuses on performing data exploration and analysis using SQL on the sample database. The goal is to gain business insights through query optimization, data joining, grouping, and aggregation.

## Overview
Sample Data is a fictional retail business database used for educational and business analysis purposes. Using Microsoft SQL Server, I wrote and executed multiple queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data across several tables such as Customers, Orders, Suppliers, Products, etc.

## Problem Statement 
The business needs to understand trends in customer behavior, supplier performance, order statistics, and product availability. These insights can drive better strategic decisions across supply chain, sales, and marketing.

## Objective
-Write SQL queries to solve 20 real-world business questions.
-Use joins, aggregations, and conditional logic.
-Identify key patterns across countries, suppliers, and customers.
-Provide data-driven recommendations.

## Tools
-Microsoft SQL Server
-SQL (T-SQL Syntax)
-SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)

## Dataset Information
The sample database includes:
-Customers
-Suppliers
-Orders
-OrderItems
-Products
  Each table contains related business information such as contact details, order transactions, inventory data, etc.

## Business Questions
I answered the following 20 business questions using SQL:
1. List all suppliers in the UK  
2. Concatenate first and last names of customers with city  
3. List all customers in Sweden  
4. List all suppliers alphabetically  
5. List all suppliers with their products  
6. List all orders with customer information  
7. List orders with product name, quantity, and price  
8. Use CASE to label products as available or not  
9. Use CASE to assign spoken languages to suppliers  
10. List products packaged in jars  
11. List products starting with "Ca"  
12. Number of products per supplier (High to Low)  
13. Number of customers per country  
14. Customers per country sorted high to low  
15. Total order amount per customer  
16. Countries with more than 2 suppliers  
17. Countries with more than 10 customers  
18. Countries with 9+ customers, excluding the U.S.  
19. Customers with average orders between $1,000â€“$1,200  
20. Orders and total sales since January 1, 2010  

## Insights
-Some countries have a large customer base but few suppliers.
-Several products are currently out of stock.
-The top customers generate average orders around $1,100.
-A number of suppliers offer a wide range of products.
-Sales are concentrated around certain product packages like jars.
-Most suppliers are based in UK, USA, and Germany.

## Recommendations
-Focus marketing on countries with more than 10 customers.
-Build more supplier partnerships in underrepresented countries.
-Monitor stock levels and automate restocking for unavailable products.
-Reward high-value customers with loyalty incentives.
-Tailor communication to suppliers based on region/language.
-Offer promotions on jar-packaged products to boost movement.
-Regularly clean data and audit for missing or inconsistent entries.
-Use insights to set data-backed KPIs for sales growth.

## Project Structure


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured query language (SQL) can be used to analyze real-world business data, solve important business questions, and drive decision-making. The hands-on experience sharpened my ability to think like an analyst, write efficient queries, and uncover insights that matter.
